# DFS
### Depth First Search
Depth First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores the deepest nodes in a graph. It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This algorithm is implemented using a stack data structure. The algorithm is implemented in the `dfs` method of the `Graph` class. The `dfs` method takes the start node as an argument and returns a list of nodes in the order they were visited.
